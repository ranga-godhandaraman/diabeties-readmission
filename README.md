Prediction of Diabetic patient re-admissions:

Problem Statement:

Hospital readmission poses additional costs and discomforts for the patients and their occurrences are indicative of deficit health service quality, hence efforts are made to predict the readmissions. 

For achieving the above, ML techniques on python is used to build a data model that predicts whether diabetic patient is readmitted to hospital or not after going through the medication. 

Certainly, Decision tree with 'Entropy' and 'Gini' is used to build the model.
